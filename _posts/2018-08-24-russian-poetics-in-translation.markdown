Of course, the interest in Russian poetics is not new. What is new, however, is a growing interest within the Digital Humanities in transforming formalist and structuralist theory into algorithms and add a quantitative angle to it. An important milestone in this respect was the international symposium in Stanford in April 2015, ["The Legacy of Russian Formalism and the Rise of the Digital Humanities"](https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/russian-formalism-digital-humanities-abstracts).

In Russia, the core texts are very present in everyday university life. Beyond Russian borders, though, it might look a bit different. Although there are a number of bibliographies of translations, it is difficult to keep track of what's there and what's not. Since we are currently [preparing some new translations ourselves](https://weltliteratur.net/moscow-formalism-and-literary-history/), we have tried to gain some kind of overview. In the course of doing so, we came across the excellent collection **"Russian Poetics in Translation"**. The 10 volumes, edited by L. M. O'Toole and Ann Shukman, were published between 1975 and 1983 (here's an [advertisement from 1982](https://doi.org/10.1515/jlse.1982.11.2.U)). Voilà, the front pages of the first five:

The collection is not available in a lot of libraries, it seems. If you're lucky, you find one or two volumes in your nearest library, but probably not the whole collection. This is why a shout-out is due to [Niederösterreichische Landesbibliothek (NÖLB)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niederösterreichische_Landesbibliothek) in St. Pölten which holds almost the entire set, donated by [Joseph P. Strelka](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Strelka), a former professor at SUNY Albany. Thus, we didn't have to go far to get hold of most of the volumes. The rest we gathered worldwide with the help of friends, and before long we were proud owners of (copies of) all volumes.

Now, in our experience, even online it is hard to throw a glance at the tables of contents per volume. Having said that, the volumes seem to be available as e-books via Amazon since 2013 (incl. the "look inside" option), yet we didn't check these versions and are unsure about how they were converted and how readable/quotable they ultimately are (if you have any experience with them, feel free to tell us).

In any case, to convey the richness of this collection, we decided to create a bibliography of all articles in all 10 volumes and publish it on this web page. We also created a [Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2113340/russian_poetics_in_translation/items) in which we listed all articles. We hope this will inspire those of you who have never heard of this collection before.
