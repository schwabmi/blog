title: About weltliteratur.net

Per farla breve: This blog accompanies our research in the field of **Digital Humanities**. It originated in our work on the (still unpublished) paper "World Literature According to Wikipedia" (there's [a preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00991)).

Just because it's so awesome we're again relying on GitHub's Jekyll static site generator for this blog. The theme we're using is *[Jackman](https://krownthemes.com/jackman/index.html)*.

Some of us are involved in the [DraCor platform](https://dracor.org/) (Drama Corpora) and the closely related DLINA venture (Digital Literary Network Analysis) that flaunts its own project blog at [dlina.github.io](https://dlina.github.io/).
