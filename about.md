Per farla breve: This blog accompanies our research in the field of the Digital Humanities. It originated in our work on the (still unpublished) paper "World Literature According to Wikipedia".

Just because it's so awesome we're again relying on GitHub's Jekyll static site generator for this blog. The theme we're using is *[Jackman](http://jekyllthemes.io/theme/7499630/Jackman-A-minimal-personal-blog-for-Jekyll)*.

Some of us are involved in the DLINA project (Digital Literary Network Analysis) that flaunts its own project blog at [dlina.github.io](https://dlina.github.io/).
